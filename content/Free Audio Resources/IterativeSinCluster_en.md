IterativeSinCluster is an additive synthesizer. This synth computes 512 sine waves for each note to make tone cluster. I somehow thought “iterative sin” is a valid term. Correct term is “recursive sine”.

- [Download IterativeSinCluster 0.1.11 - VST® 3 (github.com)](https://github.com/ryukau/VSTPlugins/releases/download/CollidingCombSynth0.1.0/IterativeSinCluster0.1.11.zip)
- [Download Presets (github.com)](https://github.com/ryukau/VSTPlugins/releases/download/EnvelopedSine0.1.0/IterativeSinClusterPresets.zip)

IterativeSinCluster requires CPU which supports AVX or later SIMD instructions.

The package includes following builds:

- Windows 64bit
- Linux 64bit
- macOS 64bit

macOS build isn’t tested because I don’t have Mac. If you found a bug, please file a issue to [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ryukau/VSTPlugins) or send email to `ryukau@gmail.com`.

Linux build is built on Ubuntu 18.0.4 and tested on Bitwig and Reaper. If you are using distribution other than Ubuntu 18.04, plugin will not likely run. In this case, please take a look at [build instruction](https://github.com/ryukau/VSTPlugins/blob/master/build_instruction.md).

## Installation

### Plugin

Place `*.vst3` directory to:

- `/Program Files/Common Files/VST3/` for Windows.
- `$HOME/.vst3/` for Linux.
- `/Users/$USERNAME/Library/Audio/Plug-ins/VST3/` for macOS.

DAW may provides additional VST3 directory. For more information, please refer to the manual of the DAW.

### Presets

Extract preset zip, then place preset directory to the OS specific path:

- Windows : `/Users/$USERNAME/Documents/VST3 Presets/Uhhyou`
- Linux : `$HOME/.vst3/presets/Uhhyou`
- macOS : `/Users/$USERNAME/Library/Audio/Presets/Uhhyou`

Preset directory name must be the same as the plugin. Make `Uhhyou` directory if it does not exist.

### Windows Specific

If DAW doesn’t recognize the plugin, try installing C++ redistributable (`vc_redist.x64.exe`). Installer can be found in the link below.

- [The latest supported Visual C++ downloads](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads)

### Linux Specific

On Ubuntu 18.0.4, those packages are required.

```plain text
sudo apt install libxcb-cursor0  libxkbcommon-x11-0
```

If DAW doesn’t recognize the plugin, take a look at `Package Requirements` section of the link below and make sure all the VST3 related package is installed.

- [VST 3 Interfaces: Setup Linux for building VST 3 Plug-ins](https://steinbergmedia.github.io/vst3_doc/vstinterfaces/linuxSetup.html)

REAPER on Linux may not recognize the plugin. A workaround is to delete a file `~/.config/REAPER/reaper-vstplugins64.ini` and restart REAPER.

### macOS Specific

When trying to run plugin first time, following message may appear on macOS.

```plain text
<PluginName>.vst3 is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to
the Trash"
```

In this case, open terminal and try running following command to unzipped `.vst3` directory.

```plain text
xattr -rc /path/to/PluginName.vst3
```

Plugin may be considered as unsigned/un-notarized application. In this case, try following the steps below.

1. Open terminal and run `sudo spctl --master-disable`.
2. Go to System Preferences → Security and Privacy → General → Allow apps downloaded from, then select “Anywhere”.

Beware that steps above degrades security of your system. To revert the settings, follow the steps below.

3. Go to System Preferences → Security and Privacy → General → Allow apps downloaded from, then select option to “App Store and identified developers”.
4. Open terminal and run `sudo spctl --master-enable`.

### Reference

## Color Configuration

At first time, create color config file to:

- `/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Roaming/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json` on Windows.
- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json` on Linux.
    - If `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is empty, make `$HOME/.config/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json`.
- `/Users/$USERNAME/Library/Preferences/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json` on macOS.

Below is a example of `style.json`.

Hex color codes are used.

- 6 digit color is RGB.
- 8 digit color is RGBA.

First letter `#` is conventional. Plugins ignore the first letter of color code, thus `?102938`, `\n11335577` are valid.

Do not use characters outside of `0-9a-f` for color value.

- `fontPath`: Absolute path to *.ttf font file. Not implemented in VST 3 version.
- `foreground`: Text color.
- `foregroundButtonOn`: Text color of active toggle button. Recommend to use the same value of `foreground` or `boxBackground`.
- `foregroundInactive`: Text color of inactive components. Currently, only used for TabView.
- `background`: Background color.
- `boxBackground`: Background color of inside of box shaped components (Barbox, Button, Checkbox, OptionMenu, TextKnob, VSlider).
- `border`: Border color of box shaped components.
- `borderCheckbox`: Border color of CheckBox.
- `borderLabel`: Line color of parameter section label.
- `unfocused`: Color to fill unfocused components. Currently, only used for knobs.
- `highlightMain`: Color to indicate focus is on a component. Highlight colors are also used for value of slider components (BarBox and VSlider).
- `highlightAccent`: Same as `highlightMain`. Used for cosmetics.
- `highlightButton`: Color to indicate focus is on a button.
- `highlightWarning`: Same as `highlightMain`, but only used for parameters which requires extra caution.
- `overlay`: Overlay color. Used to overlay texts and indicators.
- `overlayHighlight`: Overlay color to highlight current focus.

## Controls

Knob and slider can do:

- Ctrl + Left Click: Reset value.
- Shift + Left Drag: Fine adjustment.

Additionally, number sliders use in `Gain`, `Semi` etc. can do:

- Wheel Click: Toggle Min/Max.

`Overtone` has following controls:

- Ctrl + Left Drag: Reset to Default
- Mouse Wheel Drag: Draw Line

## Block Diagram

If the image is small, use Ctrl + Mouse Wheel or “View Image” on right click menu to scale.

Diagram only shows overview. It’s not exact implementation.

## Parameters

### Gain

### Shelving

Cutoff freqeuncy can be changed by `Semi`, which is relative to a note frequency. For example, if the note is C4 and `Semi` is 12.000, cutoff frequency is set to `C4 + 12 semitone = C5`.

- `Low` shelving changes `Gain` of sine waves **less than or equal to** the cutoff frequency specified by `Semi`.
- `High` shelving changes `Gain` of sine waves **greater than or equal to** the cutoff frequency specified by `Semi`.

### Pitch

### Smooth

Time length to change some parameter value to current one. Unit is in second.

List of parameters related to `Smooth`. `*` represents wild card.

- All parameters in `Gain` section.
- `Chord.Pan`
- All parameters in `Chorus` section, except `Key Follow`.

Other parameter uses the value obtained from the timing of note-on for entire duration of a note.

### nVoice

Maximum polyphony. Lowering the number of this option reduces CPU load.

### Random

### Note, Chord, Overtone

Change sine wave gain and pitch.

1 `Note` have 16 `Overtone`. 1 `Chord` consists of 8 `Note`. 4 `Chord` are available to use.

Common parameters for `Note` and `Chord`.

- `Gain` : Sine wave gain.
- `Semi` : Distance from note frequency. Unit is semitone.
- `Milli` : Distance from note frequency. Unit is 1 / 1000 semitone, or 1 / 10 cent.

Leftmost of `Overtone` is gain of fundamental frequency (1st overtone) of a note. For each bar from left represents 1st, 2nd, 3rd, … , 16th overtone gain.

Below is the summary of calculation of sine wave frequency.

```plain text
function toneToPitch(semi, milli):
  return 2 ^ (1000 * semi + milli) / (ET * 1000)

for each Chord:
  chordPitch = toneToPitch(Chord.semi, Chord.milli)
  for each Note:
    notePitch = toneToPitch(Note.semi, Note.milli)
    for each Overtone:
      frequency = midiNoteFrequency
        * (1 + mod(Multiply * Overtone * notePitch * chordPitch, Modulo))
```
